# Sable: Sure Footing

A tiny NeoForge 1.21.1 mod for [Sable](https://github.com/ryanhcode/sable) (the physics engine behind Create: Aeronautics) that keeps you moving with a contraption while you jump, so you land where you took off — including on **rotating** platforms. The player and particle fixes are client-side; the entity fix is server-side, so a server wanting correct item drops on contraptions needs the mod too.

## The bug

Sable carries entities standing on a moving sub-level by warping them along with it every tick ("tracking"). Tracking is dropped as soon as no sub-level blocks are near your bounding box — which happens near the apex of a jump. The fallback is a linear velocity snapshot, which cannot represent a rotating reference frame:

- Jumping repeatedly while standing centered on a spinning swivel bearing drifts you off by a few millimeters per jump.
- Jumping while standing at radius on a rotating platform gives you no rotational carry at all — the platform turns out from under you and you fall off beside it.

## The fix

When you leave the ground while tracked, this mod simply keeps re-applying the tracking sub-level each tick until you land, so Sable's own (correct) warp keeps carrying you through the whole jump arc. It also rotates your airborne velocity with the sub-level's per-tick rotation delta — the warp carries your *position* with the rotating frame, but without this your jump *direction* stays fixed in world space and lags behind the platform's rotation. Together they give platform-frame ballistics: jumping on a spinning platform behaves like jumping on a stationary one.

No mixins — the player fix uses Sable's helper and duck interfaces and is entirely client-side (the server adopts the client's tracking state from movement packets). Note those duck interfaces are Sable-internal (`@ApiStatus.Internal`), which is why the Sable dependency range is pinned to 2.0.x rather than left open.

Carry stops when you land, get tracked by another sub-level, enter water/lava, start flying (creative or elytra), mount a vehicle, move more than a few blocks away from the contraption's bounds (configurable), or after a timeout.

Since 1.2.0 the same treatment covers more than the player:

| What | Side | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **You** (jumping, walking) | Client | Carry through jump arcs + frame-rotate velocity |
| **Non-player entities** (item drops, XP orbs, mobs, boats…) | Server | Same carry state machine, plus items dropped over a contraption are put into its frame on their first tick (they pop upward at spawn and would otherwise never catch a fast deck). Projectiles are excluded — Sable already gives them launch velocity, and frame-locking would bend their flight. |
| **Particles** (smoke, flames, block breaking…) | Client | Sable frame-locks particles but releases them after 0.5 blocks of drift with a one-shot linear velocity — rising smoke gets flung tangentially. We re-anchor tracked particles every tick while they stay near the contraption. |

On a server without the mod, the player and particle fixes still work for clients that have it; the entity fix needs the mod on the server.

## Config (`config/surefooting-client.toml`)

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Toggle the fix |
| `rotate_jump_velocity` | `true` | Rotate your airborne velocity with the sub-level's frame, so a jump aimed across a spinning platform lands where you aimed |
| `rotate_ground_velocity` | `true` | Rotate your walking momentum with the frame too, cancelling most of the sideways (Coriolis-like) pull when moving on a fast spinner |
| `jump_rotation_strength` | `1.16` | Multiplier on the airborne rotation; 1.0 aligns to the frame but trails it slightly while your velocity is applied, values above add lead so cross-jumps stay accurate at any constant spin rate (default tuned in-game) |
| `ground_rotation_strength` | `2.25` | Multiplier on the grounded rotation; higher values also compensate per-step lag on fast spinners (tuned in-game — 2.2–2.3 walks straight), lower toward 1.0 if you curl into the spin |
| `carry_timeout_ticks` | `60` | Max airborne ticks to stay in the contraption's frame |
| `exit_distance_blocks` | `4.0` | Stop carrying once this far outside the sub-level's bounds |
| `anchor_particles` | `true` | Keep particles anchored to the contraption they spawned on while they stay near it |
| `particle_exit_distance_blocks` | `4.0` | Release distance for anchored particles (separate from `exit_distance_blocks`) |
| `debug_logging` | `false` | Log carry transitions and per-jump landing offsets |

Server-side options live in `config/surefooting-server.toml`, next to the client one. (NeoForge also reads `<world>/serverconfig/surefooting-server.toml` as a per-world **override**, but only if you put a file there yourself — it is never created for you.) The options are: `carry_entities` (`true`), `rotate_entity_yaw` (`true` — mobs and armor stands turn with the deck instead of keeping a world-fixed heading), `entity_jump_rotation_strength` (`1.16`), `entity_ground_rotation_strength` (`2.25`), `carry_timeout_ticks` (`60`), `exit_distance_blocks` (`4.0`), `carry_blacklist` (entity ids that should never be carried), and `debug_logging` (`false` — logs carried entities' positions in the contraption's own frame, for diagnosing drag; noisy, leave it off). Items dropped by someone riding a contraption are placed into the contraption's reference frame on their first tick (not at spawn — that would misplace them client-side), so they land where they were dropped however fast the deck spins, and keep turning with it once they settle. `exit_distance_overrides` sets per-entity-type carry distances, e.g. `["minecraft:item=16.0", "minecraft:experience_orb=16.0"]`, letting items and XP ride further out than mobs; an item keeps riding a deck it rests on for as long as it stays inside that distance.

## Known limits

The velocity rotation compensates everything that scales linearly with spin rate; what remains is engine-side. Sable's entity collision resolves at most 8 substeps per tick for the local player, so once a platform's tangential speed at your position passes roughly **1 block/tick (~20 m/s)**, collision itself becomes unreliable — expect phantom horizontal pushes from fast-sweeping blocks and the occasional "snowplow" shove. No client-side companion mod can fix that layer.

`exit_distance_blocks` is measured from the contraption's *axis-aligned* bounding box, not its hull, so a long ship at 45° yaw releases you further out than the number suggests. It is also slightly wider for players than for entities: Sable reports a swept box (last tick ∪ this tick) client-side and an instantaneous one server-side, so with the same setting a player releases marginally later than an item does.
